<p>A former bridge and structural engineering fully transitioned into data science and machine learning</p>

<p>I live in Johanessburg, South Africa, currently enrolled for a masters degree in data science. I am a data scientist because I love solving large, complicated problems through the acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and presentation of data.</p>
